## How to use the starter

1. Clone your own version of the starter template or fork the repository. Run `yarn` then `yarn build` or `yarn develop`.
2. The default colour scheme is purple to match the Gatsby logo. Change to your preferred hue by doing a global search and replace of '-gray-' to your favourite colour.
3. The home (landing) page consists of a number of components (Hero, Feature, CTA, ...) - edit these components in `src/components` to customise.
4. The `/contact` page displays an OpenStreetMaps map via Leaflet - customise by changing to your preferred set of coordinates.
5. `gatsby-config.js` has all the site parameters - edit site metadata to suit.
6. Create new MDX pages in `src/mdx` (using either `.md` or `.mdx` extension). Add React components to MDX in the `src/pages/{mdx.slug}.tsx` file.
7. Any content created in the `src/mdx/blog` subdirectory will automatically be a blog post. Use `src/mdx/blog/2000-01-01-template.md` as a base for creating a new blog post.
8. If you create a new tag (eg. `newtag`) a new tag page will be created ie. `/tags/newtag`. The `/tags` page will enumerate all tags.
9. If you want to change the navigation menu, edit `src/components/header.tsx`. Similarly, edit `src/components/footer.tsx` to customise the footer.
10. If you make a lot of changes, use `yarn lint` and `yarn type-check` to check everything is okay.

### Framer Motion Animations

Using Framer Motion for all site component's and page transitions including animations and for menu.

## Just Having Fun

üç∏ This website is built as static HTML with Gatsby component-modular Docker Container builds using React components and GraphQL, Built with WebPack. Including a user data backend on FaunaDB.

Served on Netlify via a continuous deployment (CD) workflow. Pull requests are automatically built into preview apps, while commits to the master branch trigger the production build and deploy onto Netlify‚Äôs CDN edge node infrastructure.

Since the whole site is just a bunch of static files copied onto multiple CDN nodes around the world, time to first byte (TTFB) is consistently fast at around 1ms to 2ms. Instant Notifications through my Slack Bots or GMail and phone notifications using Netlify Functions for my Mansbooks.com publiuslogic.com workspace.

## Gatsby Starter Publius

üöÄ This repo powers the Gatsby site hosted at publiuslogic.com. I use it to write about my personal interests, ranging from theoretical physics and spiritual learning to sustainability, web development and spending time outdoors... oh and not to forget breaking conventions like a Gatsby Site with Json-Ld per template for SEO, Internet Positioning.

Feel free to reuse any part of this repo to create your own Gatsby site.

### Server-less

üî• No run time dependency or vulnerable server stack required Pre-built pages served over a CDN for fastest time to first byte Fast and cheap CDN scaling results in ultra-high availability worldwide Server-side processes abstracted into microservice APIs for reduced attack surface areas Modern Continuous Deployment (CD) Git workflows with instant rollbacks Headless CMS for complete separation from your app/site and with full version control Modern authentication methods such as OAuth 2 for ultimate security.

## Authentication

#### What is Octokit Identity

‚ÅâÔ∏è Octokit Identity service is a plug-and-play microservice for handling site
functionalities like sign / ups, logins, password recovery, user metadata, and
roles. You can use it from single page apps instead of rolling your own, and
integrate with any service that understands JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

Learn more about this service from this
[Octokit Rest](https://github.com/octokit/auth-app.js/) üó∏

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) üó∏ by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) üó∏ for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.
