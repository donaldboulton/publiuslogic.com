## The Day

Live For the Day, Yesterday is Gone, Tomorrow is not here Yet! For the Day was made for Man, not Man for the day!

A story of Abraham. He so loved Father God making sure his path, his heart, his walk, and his talk, was set in righteousness and a true course for each and every day.

As I was taught at a young age wake up, have your coffee and a good breakfast before you view the sun rise having thanks for the new day.

At the time I was not sure where my Czechoslovakian Relatives got that from? Something Biblical?

It set a pattern for my life of doing just that.

Abraham would get up before the Sun do his thing and wait for the sun to rise so he could thank father for each and every new day and with a simple prayer, so he should live that day, guided by Father God in a path of righteousness.

Of course according to his time prostrating himself before God.

I knell before nothing!

Let me tell you a little about prostrating yourself before, God. To meditate, prostrate, hands in prayer mode or anything using the physical to get to the spirit, God or the Trinity is a lie. 

The only time you can be one with the Trinity is in your dream prayers. 

Your spirit is then released or free from your physicality; and then and only then, being one within your own spirit as your spiritual connection to the Trinity.

Most all the biblical writings the authors said these were visions from God. Some went so far as to tell us that these visions from there dreams or dream prayers.

Before my birth I sought a man of worth that could through his dream prayers seeking the knowledge of the Trinity and electrical design. The day of my birth, 11/15/1057, I gave him the knowledge of transistor, I knew I would need it as so I could write, speak and sing to All My Children at the same time. And they to Me!

## The I

The I is a Lie, live in the I and you will surly die, For the We is the All and the All is ever Lasting Life.
