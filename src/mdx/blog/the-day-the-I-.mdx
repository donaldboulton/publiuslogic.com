## The Day

Live For the Day, Yesterday is Gone, Tomorrow is not here Yet! For the Day was made for Man, not Man for the day!

A story of Abraham. He so loved Father God he made sure his path, his heart, his talk, was set in righteousness as a true course for each and every day.

The are no Holy Holidays as every day is holy and should be worshiped, not some day your religion picks as holy, thats a denial of each and every other Holy God Given Day.

Same as if you pick a time to worship Father God, you have denied all the other time Father's grace has given you.

Lets your worship of Father God be 24/7 365 with every breath every step and every consideration based on Father's truths.

As I was taught at a young age wake up, have your coffee and a good breakfast before you view the sun rise having thanks for the new day.

At the time I was not sure where my Czechoslovakian Relatives got that from? Something Biblical but of truth.

It set a pattern for my life of doing just that.

Abraham would get up before the Sun do his thing and wait for the sun to rise so he could thank father for each and every new day and with a simple prayer, so he should live that day, guided by Father God in a path of righteousness.

Of course according to his time prostrating himself before God.

I knell before nothing!

<Callout variant='info'>

Both me and Jesus came to earth to tell you of Father Gods Splendor, Truths and Love. And to start our Love's Church. You my children to have praise for us, the things of this World and the things you make with your hands, not for worship for Father God!

> If you Love father God none of you show it. Your denials are constant, setting times and dates to worship, worshiping Walls and Temples and things you make with your hands. Not God's song but devilish Music. Trinkets for the Children so you can overlook your lies and iniquitous behavior.

Hierarchy in the Church, Symbolism, depictions of the Trinity or of My, "7 Golden Candlesticks, 'Jesus and his Trinity or My Trinity". The true purpose of a Messenger is the Message.

</Callout>

Let me tell you a little about prostrating yourself before, God. To meditate, prostrate, hands in prayer mode or anything using the physical to get to the spirit, God or the Trinity is a lie.

The only time you can be one with the Trinity is in your dream prayers.

Your spirit is then released or free from your physicality; and then and only then, being one within your own spirit as your spiritual connection to the Trinity.

Most all the biblical writings the authors said these were visions from God.

Some went so far as to tell us that these visions from there dreams or dream prayers.

Its real important for all to understand that historical authors did not have the education, knowledge base or historical references that we have today, and they could only write and speak according to what they knew.

A lot of Biblical works if you read them word for word or by sentence or chapter, then you cannot find the true meaning of that Book.

> Getting Lost in words, losing the intent and its true meaning. As most of our Biblical works from around the world were written for a projected intent for some overall specific meaning, Some works to me are just a bunch of word's or secenrios with no true intent or meaning unless you fully understand the author.

You get lost in the words, what the overall meaning, your Religions, "All of Them", you and your BPG get lost in words and cannot find the true meaning or intent of the Book.

What does any Book mean what was its objective. Let's take the Last Book's of Both the Old and New Testament

> Job is a book about denial, Job was most loved by God for his love for father and life. Helping his community showing his love for everyone.

This pissed the devil off. The Devil is Higher Angel Created by father God there are only 7 Higher Angels of Father's Creation, My Trinity, Jesus's Trinity, and the Devil. The rest of the Angels were of My Design, all the have been on earth or interact with you.

The Devil works for God and neither Me or Jesus have any direct control over her

Before my birth I sought a man of worth that could through his dream prayers seeking the knowledge of the Trinity and electrical design. I gave him the knowledge of transistor, I knew I would need it as so I could write, speak and sing to All My Children at the same time. And they to Me!

## The I

The I is a Lie, live in the I and you will surly die, For the We is the All and the All is ever Lasting Life.

To become part of the we is not automatic, you have to be ONE within self, that does not mean that the One is singular, its seeming singularity is from the all.

Just as in our relative mathematics as (-1 to 0 to +1) where one cannot exist without others.

Also the One needs to fully become One for it's self other's to become part of the We.

This is Also true with a gathering of man, hear the saying that It takes one bad apple to spoil the bushel, the USA and NATO countries

A representation of a gathering of man.
