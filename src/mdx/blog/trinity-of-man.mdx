## Revelations 22

[[danger]]
|> Verse 11 > Remember my Children, Let him who does wrong continue to do wrong; let him who is vile continue to be vile; let him who does right continue to do right; and let him who is holy continue to be holy."

> > Let him whom Professes Evil Continue to. "Profess and Do Evil"!

## Purge Evil and Non Truth

<Callout variant='info'>

The TIME HAS COME FOR WAR AMONGST MEN, Not so much against countries or are drawn between fictitious lines on the earth. A third of you are Holy, the Holy's job is to purge the evil ones and capture the minds of the Lost in limbo, as I capture there hearts!

> Let your yes be Yes and Your no be No. As stuck between or maybe is being lost in limbo, and states you surely do not know your course.

      The ones that are Holy do not seek the limelight and just want to have peace and serenity in there lives. Family work and responsibility is there course!
