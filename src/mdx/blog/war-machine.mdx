### Pre planed Wars

Like all wars in this world since WWII the USA has a direct hand in it, whether our troupes fighting in the war or our weapons supplying the opposing army's.

This is most always pre planned and premeditated by Governments; "Not the people of the involved countries", 90% of the time over profit from oil or other natural resources.

Lets take Ukraine for example, the Biden Administration did all the intimidation tactics possible to provoke Putin not pacify him. Both Congress and Biden have investment in the Military Industrys and make a lot of money off of war, so they need constant war to get richer. Just like Putin money and power is all that matters. Human life is not part of the equazion, who care abut the people they represent.

## RUSSIAN HYPERSONIC MISSILES

Russian doctrine calls for short and long-range capability, as the Kremlin will have to contend with European NATO members as well as the US on the other side of the Atlantic. As such, Russia has an array of missiles that fit this purpose, such as the U-71, BrahMos II and the 3m22 Zircon.

In addition, Russia has deployed an operational hypersonic system, the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, capable reportedly of attaining a speed of Mach 10 and a range of 1700 miles, and is believed to be close to deploying a hypersonic cruise missile, the 3K22 Tsirkon. 

The Tsirkon, a sea-and ground-launched missile is intended to attain high supersonic to hypersonic speeds, between Mach 4.5 and Mach 6, and have a range of 300-620 miles. Russia has also developed an intercontinental ballistic missile-launched hypersonic glide vehicle, Avangard, which may enter service in 2019.

### CAN HYPERSONIC MISSILES BE STOPPED

Hypersonic missiles are so valuable because there is currently no operational or reliable method of intercepting them. However, as defence technology progresses countermeasures will emerge. Technologies such as directed energy weapons, particle beams and other non-kinetic weapons will be likely candidates for an effective defence against hypersonic missiles.
