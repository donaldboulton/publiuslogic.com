### Pre planed Wars

Like all wars in this world since WWII the USA has a direct hand in it, whether our troupes fighting in the war or our weapons supplying the opposing army's.

This is most always pre planned and premeditated by Governments; "Not the people of the involved countries", 90% of the time over profits from oil or other natural resources.

Lets take Ukraine for example, the Biden Administration did all the laydown, "Afghanistan, turning off USA Oil, and intimidation tactics they could figure out which will provoke Putin, not by showing USA and NATO strength or trying in some way to pacify him. 

Both Congress and Biden have investments in the Military and related Industrys and make a lot of money off of war, so they need constant war to get richer. 

Just like Putin money and power is all that matters. Human life is not part of the equations. Who care's abut the people they represent? Anywhere, look around the world at all Gov. Pay attention none have the people of there country first in there hearts and minds?

Even Ukrainian President Zelenskyy does not care about his people or country, he wants power and authority and war. 

> I look at this the way and it is not how our news and government are playing it. 
>
> To me Life is more important than power or anything else. To Me to God and for truth, lives do not matter to anyone in power anywhere.

Giving Machine guns to Old Lady's and Young people that have never even used a weapon and have no chance against even a demoralized Russian army, Zelenskyy knows this and does not care.

Zelenskyy want's to be in power and the limelight, he is a Comedian, Actor, Lier, "Ha Ha"; ya send me 10 billion, Zelenskyy will laugh all the way to a South American Bank! 

He has been clicked up with the Democrats = Clinton's, Biden's and "Obama Mostly", since before he became president!

Why do you think Donald Trump with help weapons from Ukraine until they coughed up the Clinton computer/server. Donnald knew of our secrets being sold to Ukraine/China and he knew who was responsible and Congress covered the Clinton's ass like there still doing.

Macgregor, who Trump also nominated in July 2020 as ambassador to Germany, said the war could have "ended days ago" if Zelensky had accepted what the Russians want, which he said is a "neutral Ukraine."

"I think Zelenskyy is a puppet and he is putting huge numbers of his own population in unnecessary risk," Macgregor said.

The Democrats learned really well how to win a election through the media by how Zelenskyy won, by mass media exposer and lies about his opponents, bombarding the People of Ukraine's minds into submission the same As our last election = lies and scumbagism = treason!

Zelenskyy could have at the beginning of the invasion did the smart thing and bailed out, and agreed to Russian demands, but that would mean he might not stay in power.

## Russian Demands

Most of the below could have been easily accomplished and the Ukrainian People would not be dying and the City's would not be bombed into rubble!

Nato and the USA refused to stop more expansion to NATO, according to the below demands by Putin. But life does not matter! Alliances Matter!

1. Russian leader put forward a highly contentious list of security guarantees that Moscow wants the West to agree to in order to lower tensions in Europe and defuse the crisis over Ukraine. In a joint news conference with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán following their meeting in the Kremlin, Putin said that the West has ignored Russia's demands that NATO not expand to Ukraine and other ex-Soviet countries.

> Would the USA want Russian Allies north and south of our border. "No way"! That all Putin is asking for here, he does not want to be backed into a corner with Nato Countries on his Borders. Logical!

2. Another key demand from Russia is that NATO should limit its deployment of troops and weapons to the alliance's eastern flank, in effect returning the allied forces to where they were stationed in 1997, before an eastward expansion, which would include much of eastern Europe, including Poland, the former Soviet countries of Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, and the Balkan countries.

> Same pretense as #1

3. President Putin further said that Moscow wants a guarantee from Ukraine that it will not enter the US-led NATO. 

> Same pretense as #1 and #2

4. Russia has also demanded that NATO rule out further expansion, including the accession of Ukraine into the alliance, and that it does not hold drills without previous agreement from Russia in Ukraine, Eastern Europe, in Caucasus countries such as Georgia or in Central Asia.

> Again Same pretense as above, with his allies and acquired Territories.

5. Moscow also calls for the two countries US & Russia - to pull back any short- or medium-range missile systems out of reach, replacing the previous intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) treaty that the US left in 2018. Vladimir Putin has demanded that the West provide Russia with “legal guarantees” of its security. 

> Negotiable through Diplomacy as long as Kamala Harris is not involved

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy calls on US, NATO to shut skies to Russian forces.

Fact: The fire at the Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Was started by a Flare that the plant workers fired to illuminate the plant, as so the Russians would know what they are shooting at. Later on the plant Managers said the Russian tanks knew what they were firing at because of there thermal technologies. Telling us in a round about way who's flare it was, the Russins needed no illumination.

> A lot of FAKE news coming from the Ukrainian's

Zelenskyy he does not care who dies, or if the cities get destroyed which would be the whole world if we tried that, same as our GOV, life does not matter to them.

More Power and money, but they will all die to, so what are they thinking, or do they really have the ability to think? It does not seem so.

> They are extremely Mentally Ill!

> > They Are Working for the Devil!

I told you in Creation of All, the Devil will kill all of you to keep me from capturing your hearts. See is setting you up for it right now, look and see!

## Nut Cases

🔗 [State of the Union Address](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-biden-state-of-the-union)

Ukraine after the Annexation of Crimea started asking the USA for help, and we did help, with some of our most advanced technology.

Then like the Ukrainian's have always done is sold that technology to China which sold some of to Russia. And that pissed Russia off, that they did not get it first.

China is getting advanced American technology and the Russians were not.

Why do you think Ukraine gave the Biden's/Hunter 10's of millions of dollars = for USA secrets, did not have anything to do with Oil.

Which leads us to one of the worst USA GOV conspiracies and thats selling our technology to whomever so the defense industries has to spend trillions more dollars in Research and Development to over come the high tech our GOV sold to our enemy's
 
## RUSSIAN HYPERSONIC MISSILES

From the people who maintain the "Party War Toy's", 🔗 [Party Yard](https://partyardmilitary.com/hypersonic-missiles-what-are-they-and-can-they-be-stopped/)

Read Party Yard's posts on the latest war news, they deal with whats going on with war, better news than our GOV or any of your normal news.

Russian doctrine calls for short and long-range capability, as the Kremlin will have to contend with European NATO members as well as the US on the other side of the Atlantic. As such, Russia has an array of missiles that fit this purpose, such as the U-71, BrahMos II and the 3m22 Zircon.

In addition, Russia has deployed an operational hypersonic system, the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, capable reportedly of attaining a speed of Mach 10 and a range of 1700 miles, and is believed to be close to deploying a hypersonic cruise missile, the 3K22 Tsirkon. 

The Tsirkon, a sea-and ground-launched missile is intended to attain high supersonic to hypersonic speeds, between Mach 4.5 and Mach 6, and have a range of 300-620 miles. Russia has also developed an intercontinental ballistic missile-launched hypersonic glide vehicle, Avangard, which may enter service in 2019.

### CAN HYPERSONIC MISSILES BE STOPPED

Hypersonic missiles are so valuable because there is currently no operational or reliable method of intercepting them. 

However, as defence technology progresses countermeasures will emerge. Technologies such as directed energy weapons, particle beams and other non-kinetic weapons will be likely candidates for an effective defence against hypersonic missiles.

> As it stands right now two Russian nuclear sub have been retrofitted with surface or underwater launched hypersonic glide missile's. And several are getting ready to deploy from dry dock retrofitting, soon, most of the sub fleet is being retrofitted with hypersonic weapons.
>
> > Several of there Battle Cursers ar fully hypersonic and some of there destroyers.

One of there hypersonic subs off of the east coast could fry Washington and the Eastern USA in 10 minutes before they could wake up Sleepy Joe. And there is not anything we could do about it.

There other hyper-subs would take out our Carrier groups. Our Aegis Combat System and the AN/SPY-1 radar would not even know they were coming.

> Pissing off Russia is a Stupid Move that could Kill the Whole Planet!

Now with the sanctions your going to eventually piss off the Russian People when they have no baby formula and there boys coming home in body bags. 

Then NATO and the USA will be Dust in the Wind.

<Callout variant='danger'>

If the World did not have bullies/pussies [Suckers And Losers, "Donald Trump"] to fight a War there would not be War. But you have a lot of people it this world that relish the idea of killing others and all the illusion of glory surrounding it.

Who are the Pussies and who are the Warriors?
