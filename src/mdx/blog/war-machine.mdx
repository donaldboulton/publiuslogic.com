### Pre planed Wars

Like all wars in this world since WWII the USA has a direct hand in it, whether our troupes fighting in the war or our weapons supplying the opposing army's.

This is most always pre planned and premeditated by Governments; "Not the people of the involved countries", 90% of the time over profits from oil or other natural resources.

Lets take Ukraine for example, the Biden Administration did all the laydown, "Afghanistan, turning off USA Oil, and intimidation tactics they could figure out which will provoke Putin, not by showing USA and NATO strength or trying in some way to pacify him. 

Both Congress and Biden have investments in the Military and related Industrys and make a lot of money off of war, so they need constant war to get richer. 

Just like Putin money and power is all that matters. Human life is not part of the equations, who care abut the people they represent.

Even Ukrainian President Zelenskyy does not care about his people or country. 

> I look at this the way it is not how our news and government are playing it. 
>
> And that is that life is more important than power or anything else.

Giving Machine guns to Old Lady's and Young people that have never even used a weapon and have no chance against even a demoralized Russian army, Zelenskyy knows this and does not care.

Zelenskyy want's to be in power and the limelight he is a Comedian, Actor, Lier, "Ha Ha"; ya send me 10 billion, Zelenskyy will laugh all the way to a South American Bank! He has been clicked up with the Clinton's Biden's and the Democrats "Obama Mostly", since before he became president!

The Democrats learned really well how to win a election through the media by how Zelenskyy won, by mass media exposer and lies about his opponents, bombarding the People of Ukraine's minds into submission the same As our last election = lies and scumbagism = treason!

Zelenskyy could have at the beginning of the invasion did the smart thing and bailed out, and agreed to Russian demands, but that would mean he might not stay in power.

## Russian Demands

Most of the below could have been easily accomplished and the Ukrainian People would not be dying and the City's would not be bombed into rubble!

Nato and the USA refused to stop more expansion to NATO, according to the below demands by Putin. But life does not matter! Alliances Matter!

1. Russian leader put forward a highly contentious list of security guarantees that Moscow wants the West to agree to in order to lower tensions in Europe and defuse the crisis over Ukraine. In a joint news conference with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán following their meeting in the Kremlin, Putin said that the West has ignored Russia's demands that NATO not expand to Ukraine and other ex-Soviet countries.

> Would the USA want Russian Allies north and south of our border. "No way"! That all Putin is asking for here, he does not want to be backed into a corner with Nato Countries on his Borders. Logical!

2. Another key demand from Russia is that NATO should limit its deployment of troops and weapons to the alliance's eastern flank, in effect returning the allied forces to where they were stationed in 1997, before an eastward expansion, which would include much of eastern Europe, including Poland, the former Soviet countries of Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, and the Balkan countries.

> Same pretense as #1

3. President Putin further said that Moscow wants a guarantee from Ukraine that it will not enter the US-led NATO. 

> Same pretense as #1 and #2

4. Russia has also demanded that NATO rule out further expansion, including the accession of Ukraine into the alliance, and that it does not hold drills without previous agreement from Russia in Ukraine, Eastern Europe, in Caucasus countries such as Georgia or in Central Asia.

> Again Same pretense as above, with his allies and acquired Territories.

5. Moscow also calls for the two countries US & Russia - to pull back any short- or medium-range missile systems out of reach, replacing the previous intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) treaty that the US left in 2018. Vladimir Putin has demanded that the West provide Russia with “legal guarantees” of its security. 

> Negotiable through Diplomacy as long as Kamala Harris is not involved

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy calls on US, NATO to shut skies to Russian forces.

See Zelenskyy he does not care who dies, which would be the whole world if we tried that, same as our GOV, life does not matter to them.

More Power and money, but they will all die to, so what are they thinking, or do they really have the ability to think? It does not seem so.

## RUSSIAN HYPERSONIC MISSILES

From the people who maintain the "Party War Toy's", 🔗 [Party Yard](https://partyardmilitary.com/hypersonic-missiles-what-are-they-and-can-they-be-stopped/)

Read Party Yard's posts on the latest war news, they deal with whats going on with war, better news than our GOV or any of your normal news.

Russian doctrine calls for short and long-range capability, as the Kremlin will have to contend with European NATO members as well as the US on the other side of the Atlantic. As such, Russia has an array of missiles that fit this purpose, such as the U-71, BrahMos II and the 3m22 Zircon.

In addition, Russia has deployed an operational hypersonic system, the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, capable reportedly of attaining a speed of Mach 10 and a range of 1700 miles, and is believed to be close to deploying a hypersonic cruise missile, the 3K22 Tsirkon. 

The Tsirkon, a sea-and ground-launched missile is intended to attain high supersonic to hypersonic speeds, between Mach 4.5 and Mach 6, and have a range of 300-620 miles. Russia has also developed an intercontinental ballistic missile-launched hypersonic glide vehicle, Avangard, which may enter service in 2019.

### CAN HYPERSONIC MISSILES BE STOPPED

Hypersonic missiles are so valuable because there is currently no operational or reliable method of intercepting them. 

However, as defence technology progresses countermeasures will emerge. Technologies such as directed energy weapons, particle beams and other non-kinetic weapons will be likely candidates for an effective defence against hypersonic missiles.

As it stand right now two Russian nuclear sub have been retrofitted with surface or underwater launched hypersonic glide missile's. And sever are getiing ready to depoly from dry dock retrofitting soon, most of the sub fleet is being retrofitted with hypersonic weapons.

Several of there Battle Cursers ar fully hypersonic and some of there destroyers.

One of there hypersonic subs off of the east coast could fry Washington and the Eastern USA in 10 minutes before they could wake up Sleepy Joe. And there is not anything we could do about it.

There other subs would take out our Carrier groups. Our Aegis Combat System and the AN/SPY-1 radar would not even know they were coming.
